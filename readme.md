# Hands-on workshops for GKE

These are a series of hands-on workshops designed to get familiar with some of the basic features and functionality of GKE and k8s.
If you don't already have a cluster, try using [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/#interacting-with-your-cluster) or an online kubernetes playground.
